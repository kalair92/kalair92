# **Configure Nginx Server on Ubuntu 20.04**

This guide will walk you through the process of installing Nginx on your Ubuntu 20.04 server and then configuring it alongside PHP and a Laravel Project.

## What is Nginx?

Nginx **(pronounced "engine-x")** is a popular open-source web server, reverse proxy server and load balancer. Created by Igor Sysoev in 2004, Nginx has gained significant popularity due to its high-performance capabilities and efficient architecture.

Nginx is designed to efficiently handle a large number of concurrent connections and deliver web content quickly and reliably.

### Install the Nginx web server on Ubuntu 20.04, you can follow these steps:

To open the Terminal, simply use the Ctrl+Alt+T shortcut. Then, enter the following command

### Update Package Repositories

```bash
sudo apt update
```

### Install Nginx:

Use the following command to install the Nginx package.

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

### Start Nginx:

After the installation is complete, start the Nginx service.

```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

### **Enable Nginx to Start on the Boot**

To ensure Nginx starts automatically whenever the system boots, enable it with the following command.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

### **Check Nginx Status**

You can verify if Nginx is running properly by checking its status.

```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

If the terminal displays the status below, it indicates that Nginx has started successfully:

If your system's firewall is enabled, you might need to allow incoming traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) to allow Nginx to serve web pages.

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
```

With the Nginx installation now complete, you can access the default page to verify it using a web browser.

Open a web browser and enter your server's IP address or domain name. You should see the default Nginx welcome page.

### Exploring the Core File Structure

Nginx configuration files are located in the <mark>/etc/nginx/</mark> directory. The main configuration file is <mark>nginx.conf</mark>, and sites' configuration files are stored in the sites-available and sites-enabled directories.

`Now successfully installed Nginx on your Ubuntu server. You can proceed to configure Nginx to host your websites or applications by creating server blocks (virtual hosts) and modifying the relevant configuration files`

***Certainly, here's a list of advanced Nginx server management commands for checking various aspects of your server:***

## Install Laravel on Ubuntu 20.04

The first step to check whether you can install Laravel on your Ubuntu system is to ensure you have the required prerequisites, such as PHP and Composer. You can use the following command to check if PHP is installed:

```bash
php -v
```

If PHP is not installed, you will need to install it using the appropriate package manager.

To check if Composer is installed, you can use the following command:

```bash
composer --version
```

If Composer is installed, it will display the Composer version information. If it's not installed, you'll need to install it as well.

### **Quick Commands to Install PHP and Composer on Ubuntu Nginx Server**

Setting up PHP and Composer on your Ubuntu Nginx server is essential for seamless Laravel development. Follow these concise commands to get started quickly.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php

sudo apt install php-fpm php-mbstring php-xml php-imagick
sudo apt install php-zip php-json php-cli
sudo apt install composer

php -v
composer --version

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock; # Adjust version if needed
sudo systemctl restart nginx
With these quick commands, your Ubuntu Nginx server is ready for efficient Laravel development. Stay updated by referring to the official documentation.
```

### Step-by-Step guide to installing Laravel on an Ubuntu Nginx server

**Step 1: Create Laravel Project**

Navigate to your desired project directory and run:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel your-project-name
```

**Step 3: Configure Nginx for Laravel**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/project-name.conf
```

Insert the content provided below into the `project-name.conf` file:

%[https://gist.github.com/kalair92/b75bb9144e128365f84e0a9d479c2b6e] 

<div data-node-type="callout">
<div data-node-type="callout-emoji">ðŸ’¡</div>
<div data-node-type="callout-text"><strong>Note:</strong> Depending on the PHP version you are using, modify the line <code>fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;</code></div>
</div>

**Step 4: Enable Site and Restart Nginx**

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/project-name.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

**Step 5: Configure Laravel .env**

Navigate to your Laravel project directory and copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`. Generate a unique application key:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

**Step 6: Set Permissions**

Set proper permissions for storage and bootstrap/cache directories:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path-to-your-project/storage /path-to-your-project/bootstrap/cache
```

That's it! You've successfully installed Laravel on your Ubuntu Nginx server. Access your Laravel application by visiting your server's IP address or domain name in a web browser.

Please replace `/path-to-your-project` with the actual path to your Laravel project directory. This guide assumes you have basic knowledge of Ubuntu and Nginx.

***I hope these instructions will assist you in successfully installing the Laravel project on your Ubuntu system.***
